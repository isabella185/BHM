  <li><br>Granville T. Woods was an electrical engineer who started his career after the civil war. He was self taught and created more than 50 patents in the US. In 1887, Woods received a patent for his invention of the Synchronous Multiplex Railway Telegraph, a way in which train stations and moving trains could communicate through the development of a magnetic field around a coiled wire beneath the train.<br>
